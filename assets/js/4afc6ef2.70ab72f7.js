Those with a subscription from a Working Group Two powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription by enabling products from a marketplace. We will make this happen by letting developers create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.<br><br>We are creating a product ecosystem, which is a multi-sided marketplace platform. Our solution consists of three main components:<br><br><ul><li>Developer Portal: Enabling developers to use APIs and media streams for Messaging, Data, and Voice, and to submit their product to our marketplace.&nbsp;</li><li>Partner Console: Allowing mobile operators to buy, manage, and distribute products to their subscribers.</li><li>Storefront: Letting mobile subscribers find, activate and launch the products they want to add to their subscription.</li></ul><br>THE POSITION<br>You\u2019re not afraid to get your hands dirty! You will be making both public and internal APIs, backend services, as well as architectural decisions. You will also help set up and maintain the required infrastructure for our projects. You won\u2019t be alone though, we already have a team member who is responsible for these exact things, so you will get a lot of help easing into the role.<br><br>At Working Group Two we don\u2019t have a dedicated operations team, so parts of what you will be doing may be described as a devops job. All our services run in Kubernetes hosted at AWS, so you won\u2019t need to touch actual hardware. We don\u2019t expect you to be a Kubernetes expert, as long as you\u2019re interested and &nbsp;willing to learn.<br><br><br>We\u2019re a relatively small team where team members are expected to raise their opinion and make decisions, so you will make a real impact on the direction we\u2019re going.<br><br>Most of our projects use this stack:<br><br><pre>Sketch\\nBuefy\\nVue\\nREST \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2557\\ngRPC &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2551\\nJavalin &nbsp; \u2551\\nJetty &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2551\\nKotlin &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2551\\nJOOQ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2551\u2500\u2500\u2500 This position\\nOpenID &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2551\\nEnvoy &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2551\\nNATS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2551\\nK8S &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2551\\nAWS \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u255d</pre><br><br><br>You don\u2019t have to know everything from REST to AWS.

Besides that, we are very keen on meeting up on any location of our team members to get to work together and have fun (post-covid of course). During covid, we have focused on having weekly tech-talks where we discuss and share knowledge on the projects we work on.

One of your teammates will be Jessica, and this is why she thinks you should join us:&nbsp;<br><br>If you are anything like me, a person who wants to work in a high-paced environment with ambitious and skilled people, you will fit right in here. For me it has been valuable to have so many colleagues to look up to and learn from as that has given me what I believe to be the best conditions for rapid growth. The key is to have a curious and open-to-learn mindset - if you do you will have no problem growing here. The role you take in this company is often shaped according to your interests and skills. In my case, I wanted to be more involved with the customers and follow their journey onto our platform, as well as making sure they are satisfied once migration is done. That led me to the Integrators team. Coordinating and collaborating with the development teams on behalf of our customers is one of the main responsibilities of our team as we want to deliver the best experience of our platform. That\'s where you\'ll play a key role!<br><br>Though playing such an important role may seem daunting, you will have the whole team around to support you and help you learn about our system while solving issues. In our team we want everyone to feel productive, meaning we want everyone to learn and share knowledge. We also continuously evaluate our processes to cut parts where we don\'t see any value so we can focus on our core activities. Besides that, we are very keen on meeting up on any location of our team members to get to work together and have fun (post-covid of course). During covid, we have focused on having weekly tech-talks where we discuss and share knowledge on the projects we work on. We have also started having weekly AWs/fikas where we can chat about anything to get some social time as well, which has proven to be even more valuable than we expected. Our team has many exciting opportunities and projects coming up, so if you are looking to join the fun with us - apply!\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        "]}]')}}]);
