Our team members work at all levels of our stack and have a large set of skills. Our company tech stack encompasses a wide variety of \u201ccloud-native\u201d tools and frameworks, including Kubernetes, Java, Kotlin, Go, Bazel, Envoy, AWS, and Terraform.&nbsp; But if we can\u2019t find the right tools, we build them!</p><br><p>The Infrastructure team at Working Group Two builds, maintains and runs the tools that support the engineering efforts of the rest of the company.&nbsp; While many companies take infrastructure for granted, WG2 realizes that the infrastructure work we do is vital for our platform and is a big lever that enables security, speed, agility and scale in the other teams.&nbsp; Because Working Group Two realizes that good infrastructure is a competitive advantage, we have the freedom to take a proactive approach and can plan longer-term and bigger tasks rather than only reacting to immediate needs.</p><br><p>We are now looking for an <strong>experienced infrastructure/software engineer</strong> with knowledge of cloud-based systems to join us and be part of our team building scalable infrastructure.&nbsp; We believe you have experience with at least some of the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Writing distributed, well-designed services and you know what it means to ship high-quality code.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Building infrastructure to scale up and out.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Managing container-based workloads, using Kubernetes or other orchestration software.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Site-reliability engineering&nbsp;</p></li></ul><br><p>It is beneficial if you have experience managing, operating and upgrading multiple Kubernetes clusters in a safe and reliable manner. &nbsp;Knowledge of networks in a Kubernetes environment is a plus.</p><br><h3>What will you do</h3><br><p>We work to make the business work; creating the frameworks, capabilities, and tools needed to welcome millions of users globally. The infrastructure team is responsible for the setup and management of our AWS accounts and Kubernetes clusters, running internal services, and building internal tools when we can\'t find something to meet our needs.</p><br><p>Our team may work on our Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD system, build dashboards and create alerts out of metrics, develop needed tools or help teams tune and secure their services. &nbsp;We also help ensure services that need more esoteric protocols such as SCTP, RTP and DIAMETER function in a cloud environment. &nbsp;WG2 follows the tenets of modern cloud infrastructure - we build and deploy our production systems in an immutable manner, from code. We believe in thorough metrics, monitoring, and alerting. We feel that our teams should own their services, but we in the infrastructure team should provide powerful tools to enable this.</p><br>\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        ","\\n                            <name>Our company culture</name>\\n                            <value>\\n\\n                                <p>If you join us, you\u2019ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry. Since we\u2019re solving telco problems in a modern way, we recruit from various industries and have people that used to work at Telenor, Google, Microsoft, Spotify, AWS among others. We promise that you\u2019ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a \u201cstart-up for grown-ups\u201d. We know where we\u2019re going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we\u2019ll pave the way there together.</p><p>We\u2019re a distributed company with offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm, a hub in Germany, as well as some remote colleagues in other locations (a total of 8 countries). The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        "]}')}}]);
