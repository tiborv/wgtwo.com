We\u2019re a remote-friendly and distributed team with most members located in Trondheim, Norway, and all current members are within one hour of the CET timezone (UK, Denmark, France). We do daily morning stand ups, retros every other week, and backlog grooming when necessary. And that\u2019s it. We\u2019re open to adjusting the way we work if you have any suggestions that you think could make it better.</p><p><strong>THE POSITION</strong></p><p>We need you to implement designs, and in doing so to spar with our designer, user researcher and product manager! We expect you to be very comfortable with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. We use Vue, but if you\u2019re more experienced with React we don\u2019t think that will be a problem (we won\u2019t switch to React though). The position is primarily frontend oriented, but you can also write some web controller code if you want to. Our servers are written in Javalin/Kotlin, which is very similar to Express/Typescript, so if you\u2019re familiar with that it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>Most of our projects use this tech.stack, and for this position the first seven are most relevant:</p><p>Figma<br>HTML &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>CSS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>JS &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Buefy &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Vuetify<br>Vue</p><p>Javalin<br>Kotlin<br>JOOQ/SQL<br>K8S<br>AWS</p>\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        ","\\n                            <name>Our company culture</name>\\n                            <value>\\n\\n                                <p>We\u2019re a challenger in a well established multi-billion dollar industry. To succeed as a company, we need to deliver the high quality core services that subscribers are used to, while also adding value through the way that we operate. We believe our people and our culture will be a key differentiator in achieving this.</p><p>If you join us, you\u2019ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry. Since we\u2019re solving telco problems in a modern way, we recruit from various industries and have people that used to work at Telenor, Google, Microsoft, Spotify, and AWS. We promise that you\u2019ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a \u201cstart-up for grown-ups\u201d. We know where we\u2019re going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we\u2019ll pave the way there together.</p><p>We\u2019re a distributed company with offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm, as well as some remote colleagues in other locations (a total of 10 countries). We\u2019ll pay for your phone and internet, as well as your lunch and office snacks. We\u2019ll even pay you for your work! The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks, demos, and failure fridays. During covid we replaced our quarterly offsites with online HackCays, but hopefully we can start meeting each other again soon. We also have Monday-kick offs, virtual lunches and fikas, and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun.</p><p><strong>WHAT\u2019S NEXT?</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re interested in working with us, please apply through the link below, or contact Theresa for any questions on Theresa@wgtwo.com.
